## Implementation Results

Given the following text input: `Saint Thomas Aquinas work on philosophy` to GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), an ML model originally designed and trained by OpenAI, I got the following result:

```
Saint Thomas Aquinas work on philosophy includes two versions of the Niceneâ€“Constantinopolitan Creed. While Athanasius, Augustine and Aquinas made a few changes to this formula, the form of the creed as originally composed by Athanasius has been the standard doctrinal arrangement throughout the centuries.

In the early days, the Athanasian Creed was the common form in which Christian teachers spoke in a public setting. It was a long, complex document, requiring extensive memorization of Scripture and doctrine as well as the ability to recite the creed from memory and recite it again while speaking. The Creed was composed primarily in Athanasian Greek, but many early teachers in the Church taught only the portions of the Creed that corresponded to the original version in Greek. Other portions of the creed were based on a version of the Creed in Syriac or Armenian. At least in part, a variety of forms of the Creed were used during the early Church, and a number of different copies were produced. Over the centuries, the Creed has been expanded and modified in accordance with the changing circumstances and beliefs of the Church. Thus, it is often seen in a form more appropriate to a particular situation than the original version of the Creed as it may be found in Athanasian churches today.
